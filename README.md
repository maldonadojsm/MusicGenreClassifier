# Scriabin

I've come across many people that have difficulties determining the music genre of a song when compared to determining song names. I built Scriabin to alleviate people of this stress by applying deep learning techinques. More specifically, I constructed a Convolutional Neural Network that ingests the spectograms (sonograms) of audio snippets of songs which then returns a music genre prediction. The prediction is based on 10 possible genres (Blue, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip Hop, Jazz, Metal, Reggae and Rock). More importantly, my model exceeds <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09697"> human accuracy</a> by 12%. The model has been trained using the something dataset.
